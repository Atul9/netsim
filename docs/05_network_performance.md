# Network performance

netsim runs all in memory - no packets leave our machines, hence it's super
fast compared to real computer networks. Sometimes we want to test how our
code reacts in a more realistic environment. With netsim we can simulate
[packet loss](07_packet_loss.md) and [latency](06_latency.md).
